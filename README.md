# Micro-mobility-Data-Analysis

## Overview
This project examines the utilization of micro-mobility services in Austin, Texas, and Chicago, USA. The study explores how these services can reduce the reliance on private vehicles for short-distance travel, promoting sustainable and inclusive urban transportation. The analysis uses data from public datasets and APIs, focusing on scooters, bicycles, and mopeds.
